Briefing Document: Nagarjuna's Philosophy on Causality and Emptiness

Overview: This document summarizes key themes and concepts from the selected excerpts of Peter Della Santina's work on Nagarjuna, focusing on morality, causality, emptiness, and their relation to achieving liberation (Nirvana). Nagarjuna's teachings emphasize the interconnectedness of all things, the impermanence of existence, and the importance of cultivating wisdom and morality to overcome suffering and achieve enlightenment.

Main Themes and Ideas:

Morality as Foundation:
Morality is presented as fundamental to both worldly success and spiritual progress. "Just as the earth is the basis of everything in the world, so morality is the foundation of all worldly and beyond worldly achievements. Morality is also essential for the subsequent development of concentration and wisdom, therefore cultivate it well." This highlights morality's role as a necessary precursor to deeper spiritual practices. The text cautions against non-virtuous actions of body, speech, and mind.
Giving is also emphasized as a virtuous act that creates positive future consequences: "Knowing that wealth is unstable and devoid of essence, rightly bestow gifts upon monks, br/hma%as, the poor and friends; so for the next life there is no more excellent a kinsman than giving."
The Importance of Discernment and Self-Control:
The text stresses the importance of examining the character of people before forming friendships and urges self-control, particularly regarding sensual desires: "Examine the character of people before accepting them as friends or associates... Strive to be of the last type and to have friends with a similar character."
Regarding desire, the text recommends considering others according to their age as mother, daughter, or sister and meditating on impermanence and impurity: "Do not look upon another's wife; however, should you see her, think of her according to her age - thus as mother, daughter or sister. If lust persists, then meditate well on impurity."
The mind is described as unsteady and in need of protection from sensual pleasures.
The Nature of Desire and Suffering:
Desires are portrayed as insatiable and a primary cause of suffering. They are described as "like the kimbu fruit, for they are the cause of misery." Renouncing them is presented as a path towards liberation. "Try to free your mind from desire for the pleasures of the world, because they only lead to more suffering in the long run."
The Understanding of Emptiness (Shunyata):
The excerpts introduce the concept of emptiness, asserting that phenomena lack inherent existence.
"Examine all factors of existence. Whether you search among the aggregates of the personality or among the objects found in the world at large, not a single atom really exists."
The text emphasizes that wisdom and morality are the most valuable qualities.
Emptiness is not nihilism but rather a recognition of the interdependent nature of reality. Understanding emptiness is key to destroying afflictions and purifying karma.
Equanimity in the Face of Worldly Matters:
The text encourages equanimity toward the "eight worldly dharmas" (gain, loss, happiness, unhappiness, fame, notoriety, praise, and blame), suggesting they should not disturb the mind. "O knower of the world, the eight worldly dharmas - gain, loss, happiness, unhappiness, fame, notoriety, praise and blame - should be regarded equally as (they) are not worthy of your mind."
Meditation on Loving-Kindness, Compassion, Joy, and Equanimity:
The practice of "the measureless Perfections" is advocated.
These meditations are considered virtuous practices, even if they do not lead to the "supreme state," they can result in happiness. "Always meditate rightly on love, compassion, joy, and equanimity; even if the supreme (state) is not gained in this way, still the happiness of the world of Brahm/ will be attained."
The Accumulation of Merit and Virtue:
The impact of actions is emphasized, noting that large-scale virtuous actions can diminish the impact of small non-virtuous ones. "Understand that a small measure of salt changes the taste of a little water while not that of the Ganges River; similarly, a small unwholesome deed (will not spoil) a vast root of virtue."
Impermanence and the Nature of Samsara:
The impermanence of all things is a recurring theme, highlighting the futility of clinging to worldly possessions or identities.
"Since not even ash will remain as all things - the earth, Mount Sumeru and the ocean - will be consumed by the flames of the seven suns, what need to say anything of very frail men."
The text emphasizes the cyclical nature of Samsara (the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth) and the vastness of past experiences, urging practitioners to seek liberation. "Everyone has had a heap of bones so great as to equal or surpass Mount Sumeru... the earth would not suffice to count pellets as big as the seeds of the Juniper tree to equal the mothers (one has had)."
The Path to Nirvana:
The ultimate goal is Nirvana, which is described as being beyond the concepts of existence and non-existence.
"Becoming and Nirv/%a - neither of these is existent; the complete understanding of becoming may be called Nirv/%a."
Liberation is achieved through understanding the interdependence of existence and non-existence. "The Great Person is freed through the complete understanding of (the interdependence of) existence and non-existence."
Nirvana is not annihilation but a state beyond conventional understanding.
The Intentionality of the Buddha's Teachings:
The Buddha taught the aggregates, elements, and sense spheres intentionally, not because they are real in themselves, but as a method for the worldly to approach the real state of things. "Intentionally, the Conquerors explained "I" and "Mine". Similarly, the aggregates, elements and sense spheres were also proclaimed intentionally."
Emptiness and Impermanence
Through seeing entities as impermanent, a wise man sees them as vacuous. "Those who are wise in regard to entities see that entities are impermanent, deceptive factors, pithless, empty, insubstantial and wholly vacuous."
The Importance of Understanding Vacuity:
Inferior people who don't understand the meaning of vacuity and accept merely the verbal sense do not accomplish merit and are lost. "Those inferior people who do not understand the meaning of vacuity and accept merely the verbal sense do not accomplish merit and are lost."
